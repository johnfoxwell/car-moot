# Car-moot

```
    Full stack app
```

## Description
The plan for this app was to create a full stack application that would allow uses to upload, share and chat about car details with others users. This app had the intention to first be a small landing page for a user to upload information about their own car and cars they wanted. After that the plan was to add socket.io to allows users to chat and with consideration towards sharing a users saved "cars" through the chat window. As for now the landing page is complete but other features may come with further development.


## Planned Technologies
